# img-convert
A simple image converter, powered by Go and Dear ImGui.

Basic usage:
1. Select an export type from the list
2. Drag images to convert into that type onto the main window
3. Converts the images into the same directory as the imported file

That's the basic gist. File types with settings default to the highest settings, but you can further change the
settings under options as you please.
